## Project Description
This project represents a group effort to create a DC-specific happy hour app.
Existing apps were found severely-lacking in their UI elements.
The project was conceived and organized by Adrian Kyzer.
The app was developed by a four-person team over one week.
The total time spent developing our app, including time spent learning new tools, is estimated at 80+.

We utilized Wireframe.cc, HTML, CSS with Materialize, JavaScript with JQuery and LetterFX, and Leaflet with Mapbox.
Significant time was devoted to design elements, as well as ensuring mobile-compatibility.
Internally, we created objects for each restaurant or bar, then added details such as GPS location, url, menu, and happy hour schedule. A map was created to give users the ability to select restaurants directly from it.

Look for our deployed app at: https://askyzer.github.io/happy-hour/
We anticipate continuing to work on and improve our app; please look for additions relating to use of API and databases.
We hope you enjoy our work.
